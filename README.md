Hello everyone and welcome to the blog clone project. This is my first django Project. This project will be creating a
blog and not just a personal blog but you can think of it more as a company blog since it will be able to
have multiple users. 

In this project, only superusers can write Blogs. So you can take an example of News and Media company 
which has several editors and bloggers as superusers and can have access to the admin page that is they can login and write their 
own stuff. 

I have added various features:

a) You can keep your blog in draft.
b) You can publish it whenever you want so that whole world can see it.
c) You can add your comments on other people blogs.
d) You can update and delete your post(blog) anytime you want.
